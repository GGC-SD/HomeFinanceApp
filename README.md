# Home Finance App

Budgeting applications for families, giving children insight on how to budget while also limiting what they are able to see.

## Description

Finance Tree is a family-friendly budgeting application that allows parents to add their children to see their budgets, but also prevents the children from viewing the parentâ€™s income, bills, or savings. The children can view their allowance and savings. Parents/Adults can input their income, expenses, and bills for the application to keep track of. Logging expenses also gives the user the option to mark it tax deductible and will keep track of tax deductible items giving the user an itemized list at the end of the year to reference when completing their taxes. The goal of our application was to successfully implement a NoSQL database for user tracking and to successfully run our web application through Angular.
